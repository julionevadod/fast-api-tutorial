# fast-api-tutorial
This repository will serve as a logbook for my learning about FastAPI.

Currently, repository is divided into the following modules:
- [body_data](body_data/)
- [parameters](parameters/)

Deep documentation about each of the modules will be found in the markdown inside, together with code examples in **main.py** files.
